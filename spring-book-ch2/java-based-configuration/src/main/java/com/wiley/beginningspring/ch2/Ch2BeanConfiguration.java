    by the Spring Container during bootstrap, and their returning values are treated
    as Spring‚Äêmanaged beans.
    Within a factory method, you created a bean using its concrete class and returned it
    after setting its necessary dependencies by calling its setter methods. Dependencies
    can also be given as constructor arguments.
