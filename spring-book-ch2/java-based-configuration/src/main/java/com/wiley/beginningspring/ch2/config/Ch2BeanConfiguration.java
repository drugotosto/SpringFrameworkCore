    Within the configuration class, you created two factory methods marked with the

    by the Spring Container during bootstrap, and their returning values are treated
    as Spring‚Äêmanaged beans. The method name is accepted as the bean name by default.
    Within a factory method, you created a bean using its concrete class and returned it
    after setting its necessary dependencies by calling its setter methods. Dependencies
    can also be given as constructor arguments.
